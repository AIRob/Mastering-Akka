#Mastering Akka
This is the code repository for [Mastering Akka](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-akka?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=Repository&utm_campaign=9781786465023), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
{
"firstName": "Chris",
"lastName": "Baxter",
"email": "chris@masteringakka.com"
}
```

Creating a game is an elaborate task that will require a combination of assets and code. To
create assets and code, we'll need some pretty advanced tools, including art tools, sound
tools, level-editing tools, and code-editing tools. Assets include any visual artwork (2D sprites,
3D models), audio (music and sound effects), and game levels. To perform that, we'll set up
a C++ coding environment to build our UE4 applications. We'll download Visual Studio 2015,
install it, and set it up for UE4 C++ coding. (Visual Studio is an essential package for code
editing when editing the C++ code for your UE4 game.)
